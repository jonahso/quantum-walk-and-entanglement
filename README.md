# quantum walk and entanglement 

The github repo provides several notebooks that combines graph-based Hamiltonians, quantum time evolution, and entanglement measures to study how information spreads in quantum systems. 

## random walk

This notebook explores how entanglement entropy evolves during quantum walks on various graph structures, including glued-tree graphs. 

## trotter steps

This notebook implements trotter steps, corresponding to the paper "... " utilizing cudaq, which efficiently expended the system size to up to 25 qubits. 

The document below records the performances of qiskit CPU, qiskit GPU and cudaq GPU:
